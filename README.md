handhRL
=======

A simple roguelike based on the Hulks and Horrors tabletop RPG written with Python 2.7 and libtcod.

As of now the engine is complete, but additional work will be needed to build it up to a more accurate representation of the source. The eventual goal is to be as accurate a representation of the H&H rules as can be managed, allowing for adjustment to the form.

Code is based on the excellent tutorial here: http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Complete_Roguelike_Tutorial,_using_python%2Blibtcod

Hulks and Horrors is a tabletop roleplaying game inspired by classic Red Box, with a sci-fi reimagining. More on that here: http://www.bedroomwallpress.com/p/hulks-and-horrors.html
